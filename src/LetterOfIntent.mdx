## Letter of Intent

### Hello

With a background in graphic design and over two decades of experience in full stack web development, I am passionate about programming and have a particular focus on JavaScript/TypeScript.

As I am seeking a new challenge in my career, I am looking for an environment where I can learn from experienced teams and take on large projects. I am eager to join a new company that can provide a challenging work environment, a focus on writing tested code, and a CI/CD environment using GIT version control.

I am also seeking a role that would allow me to work 80 % part-time. I am open to discussing a minimal annual salary of USD 125 000.– for a full-time equivalent position.

I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.

<br />

Sincerely, <br />
_Stefan Huber_
