## Letter of Intent

### Hello

In the last century I started an education in graphic design. During the last two decade I gradually changed from design to full stack web development.
I feel passionate about programming and during the last couple years I focused mainly on JavaScript/TypeScript.
Finding a new challenge in my work is a goal for the next few years, and I am aiming for an environment where it is possible to learn from experienced teams and where large projects are handled.

I would love to switch gears and work in a new company, if the job fulfills the gaps I am missing in my current position. The following points for a new occupation should be given:

- Challenging work environment
- Time is given to write tests
- CI/CD environment (GIT version control)
- Maximum 80 % part time (I teach at the [School of Design · Zurich](https://sfgz.ch/))
- Minimal USD 125 000.– annual salary (for full-time equivalent)

Feel free to contact me.

<br />

Sincerely, <br />
_Stefan Huber_
