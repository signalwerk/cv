## Letter of Intent · Black[Foundry] · Fontra

### Hi Black[Foundry] Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out because I've developed a strong interest in the [Fontra project](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontra). As someone with a background in graphic design and more than two decades of experience in full-stack web development, I believe I could make a meaningful contribution to the work, especially given my particular focus on JavaScript/TypeScript.

I joined a [discussion about Fontra](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontra/discussions/194#discussioncomment-6095424) that started after [your tweet](https://twitter.com/blackfoundry/status/1595744733770706944). Although my initial post was overlooked for a while, I'm still very keen on the idea of working together.

Font engineering has been a passion of mine for quite some time, and working on an open-source project like [Fontra](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontra) sounds absolutely exciting to me.

Here some bullet points in addition to [my CV](https://cv.signalwerk.ch/) to show my long lasting interest in graphics/font engineering:

- 2000 · First graphics programming (PostScript)
- 2009 · First custom font design (Dahrendorf for [Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin](https://www.wzb.eu/))
- 2015 · First [font related programming](https://github.com/signalwerk/fontstep)
- 2017 · First [UI Concept](https://paramatters.signalwerk.ch/ui/) for font editor
- Attended many type and OpenSource meetings like [Day of Font](http://www.typo-online.ch/tds/2023/), [Kerning<sup>†</sup>](https://kerning.it/) or [Libre Graphics Meeting](https://libregraphicsmeeting.org/)

I eagerly anticipate the prospect of discussing how we might align our efforts to elevate the Fontra project. Thank you for your time and consideration.

<br />

Best, <br />
_Stefan Huber_
