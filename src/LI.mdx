## Letter of Intent

### Hello
In the last century I started an education in graphic design. During the last decade I gradually changed from design to full stack web development.
I feel passionate about programming and during the last couple years I focused mainly on JavaScript.
Running an own company is a great experience but the teams I work with are either teams without other developers or where I fill the position as head of development. Searching for a new challenge in my work is a goal for the next years and I strive for a setting where it is possible to learn from more experienced developers and where larger projects are possible.

I would love to switch gears and go back to work in a company, if the job fulfills the gaps I am missing in my current position. The following points for a new occupation should be given:

* Challenging work environment
* Time is given to write unit tests and (light) documentation
* CI/CD environment (GIT version control)
* 80 % part time (I teach sometimes on Friday/Saturday)
* minimal CHF 120 000.– annual salary (for full-time equivalent)


Feel free to contact me.

<br />

Sincerely, <br />
*Stefan Huber*
